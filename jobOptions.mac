# Choose the physics list.  
# Physics lists are described in the Geant4 documentation at 
# http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc_mod_catalog/physics_lists/physicsLists.shtml
# and 
# http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc_mod_catalog/physics_lists/referencePL.shtml
# and

#
# The list of available physics lists is output during WCSim initialization.
# A "WCSim" physics list is provided in addition to the Gean4 lists for backwards-compatibility
# uncomment one line below to choose the physics list
#
#/WCSim/physics/list QGSP_BIC_HP #preferred for energies below 5 GeV
#/WCSim/physics/list LBE # preferred for low-background experiments.  
/WCSim/physics/list WCSim # included for backward-compatibility.  Requires jobOptions2.mac


#choose the Trigger & Digitizer type (and options)
# set at least one of the following two options (both /DAQ/Digitizer and /DAQ/Trigger to be sure) to SKI_SKDETSIM if you want to use the old combined Digitization & Trigger class (WCSimWCDigitizer)
/DAQ/Digitizer SKI
/DAQ/Trigger NHits
#do we want to save only triggered events (mode 0), both triggered events & failed events (mode 1), or only failed events (mode 2)?
/DAQ/TriggerSaveFailures/Mode 0
#what trigger time to use for the failed events?
/DAQ/TriggerSaveFailures/TriggerTime 100
# control the NHits trigger threshold
/DAQ/TriggerNHits/Threshold 25
# control the NHits trigger window (ns)
/DAQ/TriggerNHits/Window 200
#automatically adjust the NHits threshold depending on the average noise occupancy during the trigger window
/DAQ/TriggerNHits/AdjustForNoise false
# control the number of nearest neighbours to define "local" for the local NHits trigger
